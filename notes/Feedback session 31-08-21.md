# problem z [[poziom trudności]] 
"This game started great but ended up feeling like a freemium game. It required that I use power ups constantly." ^2e4046

"Enjoyed the game for a while...but [[L62]] of the sand I don’t see how it is possible to pass without a lot of boosts...tried 10 times and never got close to the bottom....so I decoded to use my boost.." ^41dc51

z [[drop rates]] wychodzi na [[brak kulek]] albo hipoteza: 

[[side-towers nie są zrozumiałe]]

[[cages]]:
- za dużo na planszach

"The blocks themselves are not tough to deal with, but if the level you’re trying to play through needs you to break so many and you don’t at the start, you can easily lose. So while other levels lets you unleash mayhem, those shield block levels just grinds it a halt." [[nie wiadomo ile jeszcze objectiva jest do zebrania na planszy]] ^38b972

# [[2lives]]:
## za bardzo zaburzają dynamikę:

"the ‘double hit’ blocks in particular ruin the flow of the game completely for me, and I’ve stopped playing after [[L20]] or so."
"not sure what is the point of shield blocks, but being forced to collect them ruins the game." ^b71b8a

## za szybko wchodzą [[objectives]] które zaburzają walenie się wieży:
"Worse still, like many match 3 games, it also makes the mistake of adding ‘tough’ and unbeatable blocks too early, mechanics that, combined with goals that also work against the physics, end up taking the fun out really early."

## zbyt irytujące dla graczy:

"There’s a fine line between challenging and frustrating. The new levels have firmly crossed into the frustrating zone. I literally hate any level with the ‘shield blocks’ (or whatever they’re called). [[L88]] has convinced me to delete the game from my phone." ^e8fd08

[[dragon]]
"I am stuck in [[L101]] where they made the dragon static and it has to eat blocks. They made these blocks fall way too easy to high is normally great. The dragon does not eat enough and after 70 tries I am giving up. Fun game minus the glitch and the impossible level." ^1e3692

# potrzeba nowego [[game mode]]:
- free roam mode - bez [[objectives]] i [[mechanik przeszkadzających]], samo walenie wieży
"I’m begging someone to please add a free play option, some kind of mode where the aim is to knock down as many blocks in one go without the need for collecting certain colours or hitting blocks more than once. This would still be disappointing because I’d like to be able to progress through the levels in the main game, but even as a secondary, stress relieving, fun playing experience, a free play mode would keep me playing the game"

"A ‘zen’ mode would be amazing. Not a fan of the increasing goals… I just wanna zone out, not think too hard & knock some things down.

## [[objectives]] nie są potrzebne:
"Great concept. Too bad they messed it up with having to concentrate on completing 2-4 side missions on every level instead of enjoying the mechanic itself"

"The most enjoyable aspect is seeing the tower tumble (...) however, the level objectives so far [[L18]] are based around clearing large groups alla any other block shooter puzzle. This leads to a disconnect between what I’m finding fun and what I need to do to win each level. Not a huge issue but leaves me feeling that the whole thing could be more enjoyable." -> wynika z tego, że [[cages]] i [[2lives]] wspierają matchowanie dla wygranej ala match3 i nie o tym jest nasza gra ^e16921

# [[scoring]] 
nie jest zrozumiały:
- gracze nie wiedzą jak grać najlepiej i żeby zdobywać najwięcej punktów:
"Like others have mentioned, I’ve played all the way through and still don’t understand the best way to play and how points are awarded. It makes it much less fun to play."

"There are objectives for each level but they’re not what’s needed to get three stars"
- za ciężko zdobywa się [[3 stars]]:
"I’m at the end of world 2 and I couldn’t 3 star any level there (from 65 and after )  
Been playing for days  
Please improve the scoring system"

"No indication of what is needed to secure the stars. Minimal guidance I love “match” games and this one is grating."

"You just got nowhere close to 3 stars this level, what did you do wrong? No feedback."

nie jest przemyślany:
"Both combos and leftover balls grant points, when’s it worth firing extra? Try to guess. Should you be trying to save balls for points here, or will you run out of any opportunity to collect certain blocks before the end?"

"Way more points are awarded for big color matches instead of the more satisfying big topples."

problem z komunikacją [[scoring]]:
"You are also supposed to get 3 stars, but the blocks that fall by themselves don’t give you points, only those that you hit directly."

# [[rewarding]]
- nie idzie w parze z corem funu:
"The game wants you break blocks with shots, not physics. It places goals on levels (break 40 red, for example), and requires you hit that goal with blocks instead of physics. Destroying 400 red with well designed wall collapses would not count, in that example."


# [[ceny powerup upgrades są za wysokie]] są za wysokie
"And 30k coins for 3 power ups each level ?!!! That’s toooo much coins"

# [[progresja nowego biomu]]

zmiana dynamiki plansz
"When I got to about [[L35]] it changes nature from being a fast, joyful, blast-away game to being one that needs planning and timing that includes sitting and waiting for the right moment. As I go further, success on a level depends a lot on luck, too. If the blocks of given colors don’t align properly, it can be impossible to get three stars. Just keep playing for the right happenstance. The result of this is that it is a game I like less the more I play it. On the other hand, I didn’t pay any money for it, either. Apple Arcade makes it so it’s easy to play a game until it is no fun any more and move on. I am almost to the point of moving on. It is just more of the same every level only less fun after each victory." ^60bfe9
